 - Gephi -> Network Viewer (general) - Java 7
 - Web of Science - SCOPUS -> Get .ciw file from WoS
 - Citation report (interest by year) (save to EndNote desktop -> Full record)
 - Mining is available (sublimetext)
 - With VOSViewer - create (map-biblio) (WoS) -> Choose Analysis (country, etc.) - Author -> Keyword Threshold

 - Layout -> Yifan Hu proportional (good example)
 - Statistics (weights, degree) Rank
 - Modularity -> Finding community favtor
 - Partition -> Modularity class
 - Click T in Graph
 
 - Set Degree Range in Filters next to Statisticd (rhs) (Topology) -> Move to queries below
 - Ego Network -> Direct connections (in filters)
 - Peripheral keywords (weakly coneected) e.g. RadioAstro <-> Site Testing
 
 
 - VOSViewer co-citation at beginning(author by author)
 - Directed (option in Gephi) -> Data Laboratory + Preview -> Statistics + Partitioning
 - Force Atlas 2 in Layout - use filter
 - Rank -> Max size + Modularity -> Right click -> Data Laboratory (1998 Rosenkranz - Radio Science)
 - May not be in sample
