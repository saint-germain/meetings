### Day 1

#### Overview - Anna Scaife - Manchester

- Newton Fund delivery data for RADA Big Data is UK STFC (Astro-Particle-Nuclear).
- Amount: GBP 370k
- Programs: Astro-Agri-Health.
- Methods: Image analysis, Time Domain Analysis, Mining, Machine Learning.
- Matched funding (UK+CO) through MSc studentships + co-supervisor travel funding
- MinTIC also matches with HPC facilities use and local support.
- (At least) one colombian co-supervisor per projects.
- UManchester (+ Manchester Metro), ULeeds, UHertfordshire
- Projects: 
  - Pattern finding (Leeds, Manchester, ECCI)
  - RFI + Power Walls (Leeds) *Needs co-supervisor*
  - Stellar Populations (Hertforshire + UdeA)
  - Object detection, extraction, classification in radio astronomy (Hertfordshire) *Needs co-supervisor*
  - Magnetic fields in Star-Forming Regions (UdeA)
  - Image Data Mining for Radiotherapy (UManchester, EAFIT)
  - Big data for beast cancer treatments (UManchester, EAFIT)
  - Big Data Techniques for Satellite Image Analysis (UManchester)  *Needs co-supervisor*
- Long term ambitions 
  - From MSc to PhD
  - Broad balanced research netowrk
  - GCRF opprtunities for growing RADA
- Specifics on MSc
  - Physics, Engineering, Sciences candidates are OK
  - Flexible deadline for English-language requirements(Acceptance pending English Language requirement)
  - Starting date -> July - fixed date
  - Co-supervisors will rank applicants for each project
  - Co-supervisors can write letters for projects
  - Duration of MSc is 1 yr, no courses, only research
  - Project distribution will likely be 1 He + 1 Ag + 4 As

### Colombian Partners

#### Jaifa Mezher - Head of international office of MinTICs (with Ivan Castaño)
 
 - Plan vive digital para la gente - Big Data policy.
 
#### Jorge Caldas - CAOBA
 
 - CAOBA already has 4 students - already locked funding and projects already underway
 - Projects are not known at the moment
 
#### BIOS

- UNAL, UTP, and MinTICs are on the board of BIOS - students will have priority
- Facilities
  - 8 TB RAM, 532 TB storage
  - Video wall

### Projects

#### Roy Ruddle - Powerwall + RFI
  
- Procedure to remove radio noise (6 Mpx @BIOS)
- Develop more robust data processing method
- With Melvin Hoare and Javier Moldon
- eMerlin (VLBI) data
- Flagging (20% of the data)
- Freq vs. Time (also polarization)

#### Melvin Hoare - As1 + As2

- Pattern finding in samples of spectroscopic data
	- Locally Linear Embedding on spectra (Daniel et al 2011)
	- Isomap (Sasdelli et al 2016)
	- Dataset - ALMA data cube eg w33A
	- ML techniques applied

#### Joe Fennell - Ag1

- Physics for global food security problems
- With Sarah Bridle (STFC Food Network)
- Using multispectral satellite imaging
- Weed mapping (Blackgrass in UK)
- Precision agriculture in orchards
- Imaging for pest tracking
- Land cover classification -> Bird populations
- CABI -> Pathways to impact

#### Eliana Vásquez Osorio - Health

- Image data mining for radio therapy treatment
	- Improve survival rate by sparing a specific region of the heart


  
- BIOS scholarships should be among already-enrolled students for projects 
- Could we have slides
