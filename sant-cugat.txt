M. Padovani: CR shocks â€”> TD chemistry + trapping

J. Simon: ATHENA code for planetesimal formation (using FFT). Also for planetarium shows! Planetesimal mass function! dN/dM vs. M (or R)

Z. Leinhardt: % of collisions (type of process) vs. number of collisions in n-body simulations. Separate embryos from planetesimals

C. Ormel: Stokes parameter: stopping time/encounter time. St<1 == pebble accretion. Pebble accretion radius formula dep. on sweeping velocity (<vkep).

S. Desch: 3 Myr, 170 K, 2.7 AU snowline for meteorites. Hard to explain conditions? IS UV causes gas to move outward, depleting the "hard" snowline of H2O to freeze and keeping ice out(?)

C. Eistrup: Nothing happens with MC conditions + low ionization rate

B. Ercolano: 4 week workshop in 2017 (Deadline: 29 Aug 2016) http://www.munich-iapp.de/scientific-programme/programmes-2017/protoplanetary-disks/?L=%2Fproc%2Fself%2Fenviron 

A. Shannon: Grand Tack - Moving Jupiter by Walsh et al 2011,2012

R. Dong: Linear theory (Goldreich & Tremaine) 1 arm = 1 planet. Also- Gravitational instabilities can explain shape of arms. Keck- Possible detection of extrasolar planet exactly where linear theory predicts! More observations are required. Jansen+16 show arms rotating in different directions. MWC 758!

HL Tau: 1 Myr \pm 100 kyr. 

L. Rogers: 2015 posterior for rocky planet formation vs. radius. Most 1.6 Re planets are not rocky. TESS, CHEOPS,PLATO+ground based. This will get much better. Simulate the posteriors for all important parameters, recover initial values.

K. Kratter: Gravitational instability CAN make planets (around eccentric binaries). However, binary or triple star systems are also likely to form.

R. Pudritz: Dead zone boundaries, pressure gradients in general act as planet traps. CRI will matter. Hasegawa & Pudritz 2013 evolutionary tracks for planets. Super-earths are planets for which there is no gas left in the disk to accrete. Alessi Pudritz Cridland -> simulating planet distributions based on CRI rates. HSC geochemistry equilibrium code for minerals (35 mineral species).

A. Collier-Cameron: Struve 1952 paper (1st cite 30+ yrs later)

B. Bitsch: Bitsch + Johansen 2016 effect of water on opacity! Transition at water ice line

Ideas: Montecarlo for CRUV rates. Check for X-ray physics in ProDiMo.
