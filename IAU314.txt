IAU Symposium 314
Young Stars and their Planets

MONDAY
Kastner Keynote:
Mamajek-Bell 2014 review of ages & papers related
Close binary + disk Valere Rapson Kastner Andrews ApJL 2015
Mamajek Focus:
B8 (old stars) all over the FOV
Membership selection - Spaghetti method, Convergent point method (will be outdated after GAIA)
Small v dispersion for NMG, near LSR
V-K MV color mag diagram for zams
32 Ori - 20 Myr @ 90 pc
\eta Cha + ejected members 9 Myr
Alessi 13 (Brazilian amateur astronomer) 500 Myr
Castor MG? Fomalhaut+Vega; \Delta v=11 km/s - probably not a common origin
Sco-Cen 10^4 stars, 110-170 pc - Age substructure (gradient); Mark Pecaut PhD thesis
Lison Malo:
Statistics+Membership
Velocity+Position;Photometry;Age (rotation, X, U, Lithium, Disk)
V+P: SACY (Torres 2006,2008)
David Montes:
Chemical tagging based on metallicity
Marc Pinsonneault:
Age diagnostic - Lithium (GKM) is sign of youth
Onset of Li depletion in BD (20-100 Myr!)
Rotation -> problematic for younger stars - Epstein & MP 2014
Breakdown of models - B fields, Rotation, Star spots, might not be as important to 1st order? 
B fields might affect Li dispersion and thus isochrones e.g. Pleiades (star spots)
Importance in time domain - Observe oscillation to characterize stars - Asteroseismology even for protostars (K2!)
Cameron Bell:
Trouble with Isochrones (wide dispersion) Stauffer at al 2007 + more recent papers
Models at http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/timn/isochrones/
32 Ori 22\pm3 Myr
Tuc-Hpr 44 5
Columba 46 8
Carina 36 8
Beta Pic 23 3
Evgenya Shkolnik:
Search for YS in GALEX+ROSAT NUV+FUV+X-rays
NUV/J vs J for YS < 25 pc
Li - age; K surf. gravity
New Tuc-Hor Members - inactive
New work on EUV prediction from GALEX data
Questions: H alpha breakdown for other spectral indices? Water delivery in planetary atmospheres? Ciesla work
Jonathan Gagne:
BANYAN online tool for Bayesian identification of YMG members in XYZUVW space
Brown stars (many BD detected in Tuc-Hor)
L/T transition in the IR?
Companions - BASS survey -> colder and colder stars > L5 in literature (T dwarf)
Simon Murphy:
Sco-Cen -> UCL LCC understudied - Age spreads, substructure
JASoN Survey -> Bayesian approach using proper motions from UCAC4 and SPM4: photometry + spectroscopy
Song et al 2012 - Ages of LCC UCL and Beta Pic
Rebeca Azulay:
VLBI program (Valencia, Spain+Australia) phase reference for observing AB Doradus (two components)

TUESDAY
Sean Matt:
Gallet & Bouvier 2010 - Dependence of rotation evolution for different mass stars.
Not solar wind (1e6 times needed) probably star-disk interaction
Matt et al 2014 movie, spindown of higher mass stars, slower for low-mass stars
Saturation threshold for torque(?) 
Need scaling of mass loss rate+B fields, direct measurements of dM/dt
Core envelope decoupling could explain lack of slow, low-mass rotating stars
Gaitee Hussain:
Transition from dipolar fields into toroidal fields just as radiative core sets for M dwarfs with not-so-low masses.
Magnetic cycles might play a role?
Lucas Cieza:
Ribas 2015 - Mass dependence of dissipation timescales
80% of nearby disks have all-lambda SED
20% are transitional disks
Sebastian Daemgen:
Measure dust mass with ALMA
Andrews 2013 - Disk mass dependence on stellar mas
197 sources w/ Spitzer - Mathews et al 2012
Binaries disks are shorter lived than singles
Undetected binary companions may change shape of lifetime trend
Kraus 2012 makes a lifetime curve w/ singles -> above all-stars curve, must start from 100% disk fraction for young, nearby stars.
Dust > Gas for binaries
Nienke van der Marel:
Causes of Cavity clearing - Grain Growth, Photoevaporation, Companion, Deadzones+Instabilities
Drag forces = Dust trap for medium-sized particles
Can be created via density or viscosity gradients
DALI - Tool for CO emission modeling - van der Marel 2015
Density is dropped by a factor 10
Karin Ã–berg:
TW Hydra - not necessarily a model system
Cold dust grains can be amassed near snowlines
Local setting of C/O ratio can depend on snowline
N2H+; J=4-3 tracer of CO (or lack thereof)
17 K freeze-out temperature for CO in TW Hya
Freeze-out temp. can change depending on local conditions
Merchantz+Cleeves: CO to CO grains
Detection of C2H in TW Hya (small C chains)
Detection of CH3CN in MWC480
Gilles Chabrier:
