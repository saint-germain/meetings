IAU Symposium 314
Young Stars and their Planets

MONDAY
Kastner Keynote:
Mamajek-Bell 2014 review of ages & papers related
Close binary + disk Valere Rapson Kastner Andrews ApJL 2015
Mamajek Focus:
B8 (old stars) all over the FOV
Membership selection - Spaghetti method, Convergent point method (will be outdated after GAIA)
Small v dispersion for NMG, near LSR
V-K MV color mag diagram for zams
32 Ori - 20 Myr @ 90 pc
\eta Cha + ejected members 9 Myr
Alessi 13 (Brazilian amateur astronomer) 500 Myr
Castor MG? Fomalhaut+Vega; \Delta v=11 km/s - probably not a common origin
Sco-Cen 10^4 stars, 110-170 pc - Age substructure (gradient); Mark Pecaut PhD thesis
Lison Malo:
Statistics+Membership
Velocity+Position;Photometry;Age (rotation, X, U, Lithium, Disk)
V+P: SACY (Torres 2006,2008)
David Montes:
Chemical tagging based on metallicity
Marc Pinsonneault:
Age diagnostic - Lithium (GKM) is sign of youth
Onset of Li depletion in BD (20-100 Myr!)
Rotation -> problematic for younger stars - Epstein & MP 2014
Breakdown of models - B fields, Rotation, Star spots, might not be as important to 1st order? 
B fields might affect Li dispersion and thus isochrones e.g. Pleiades (star spots)
Importance in time domain - Observe oscillation to characterize stars - Asteroseismology even for protostars (K2!)
Cameron Bell:
Trouble with Isochrones (wide dispersion) Stauffer at al 2007 + more recent papers
Models at http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/timn/isochrones/
32 Ori 22\pm3 Myr
Tuc-Hpr 44 5
Columba 46 8
Carina 36 8
Beta Pic 23 3
Evgenya Shkolnik:
Search for YS in GALEX+ROSAT NUV+FUV+X-rays
NUV/J vs J for YS < 25 pc
Li - age; K surf. gravity
New Tuc-Hor Members - inactive
New work on EUV prediction from GALEX data
Questions: H alpha breakdown for other spectral indices? Water delivery in planetary atmospheres? Ciesla work
Jonathan Gagne:
BANYAN online tool for Bayesian identification of YMG members in XYZUVW space
Brown stars (many BD detected in Tuc-Hor)
L/T transition in the IR?
Companions - BASS survey -> colder and colder stars > L5 in literature (T dwarf)
Simon Murphy:
Sco-Cen -> UCL LCC understudied - Age spreads, substructure
JASoN Survey -> Bayesian approach using proper motions from UCAC4 and SPM4: photometry + spectroscopy
Song et al 2012 - Ages of LCC UCL and Beta Pic
Rebeca Azulay
VLBI program (Australia) phase reference for observing AB Doradus (two components)



Look at:
Baraffe & Chabrier 20?? Role of accretion - Ages
Malo 2014 Effects of B field in PMS evolution - Li depletion
Shkolnik 2011 UV - GALEX sample + H alpha analysis for M Dwarfs
Kraus, Shkolnik et al 2014 - New Tuc-Hor Members
Shkolnik 2014 UV vs. age
